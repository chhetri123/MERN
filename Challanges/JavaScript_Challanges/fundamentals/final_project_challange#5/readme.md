Here are some questions and challenges based on the To-Do List mini project:

### To-Do List Application Challenges

#### Basic Questions

1. **Task Addition**

   - **Question**: Modify the `addTask()` function to prevent adding duplicate tasks. How would you implement this check in the function?

2. **Task Removal**

   - **Question**: Add validation to the `removeTask()` function to ensure that a user cannot remove a task from an empty list. How would you implement this validation?

3. **Task Completion**

   - **Question**: Update the `toggleComplete()` function so that it can handle marking multiple tasks as completed at once. How would you modify the function to allow this?

4. **Task Sorting**
   - **Question**: Adjust the `sortTasks()` function to sort tasks alphabetically by their text in addition to sorting by their completion status. How would you achieve this?

#### Additional Task History

1. **Undo Last Action**
   - **Question**: Implement an `undoLastAction()` function that reverts the last task addition, removal, or completion change. How would you design this function and handle different types of actions?
