## Basic Challange

## Instruction #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height \*\*2 = mass / (height \* height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

TEST DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

## Instruction #2

There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins the a trophy!

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score).

3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. HINT: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜‰
4. BONUS 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

TEST DATA: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110

TEST DATA BONUS 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123

TEST DATA BONUS 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106

## Coding Challenge #1

## Instructions:

1. Create a variable called `temperature` and assign it a number value.
2. Use an if-else statement to check if the temperature is above or below freezing (0Â°C or 32Â°F).
3. Print a message to the console based on whether it's freezing or not.

## Challenge 2: Temperature Conversion

### Instructions:

1. Create a boolean variable `isCelsius` (true for Celsius, false for Fahrenheit).
2. Convert the temperature to the other unit (Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa).
3. Print both the original and converted temperatures.

## Challenge 3: Temperature Status

### Instructions:

1. Use the `temperature` and `isCelsius` variables from Challenge 1.
2. Determine if the temperature is freezing, moderate, or boiling.
3. Print the temperature status.

## Challenge 4: Temperature Message

### Instructions:

1. Use the `tempStatus` from Challenge 2.
2. Create a message about the temperature using logical operators.
3. Print the message.

## Challenge 5: Even or Odd Temperature

### Instructions:

1. Use the `temperature` variable from the previous challenges.
2. Use the modulus operator to check if the temperature is even or odd.
3. Print whether the temperature is even or odd.

## Final Challenge: Combine All Concepts

### Instructions:

Combine all the concepts from the previous challenges into one comprehensive script.
