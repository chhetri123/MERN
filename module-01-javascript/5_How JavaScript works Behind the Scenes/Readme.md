## 1. A High-Level Overview of JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It's multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. JavaScript runs on the client-side of the web, which can be used to design/program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event.

Key features:

- Dynamic typing
- First-class functions
- Object-oriented programming with prototypal inheritance
- Closures

Example:

```javascript
// Dynamic typing
let x = 5;
console.log(typeof x); // "number"
x = "Hello";
console.log(typeof x); // "string"

// First-class functions
function greeting(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const sayHello = greeting;
console.log(sayHello("Alice")); // "Hello, Alice!"
```

## 2. The JavaScript Engine and Runtime

The JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code. The most well-known is Google's V8 engine, used in Chrome and Node.js.

Components of a JS Engine:

1. Memory Heap: Where memory allocation happens
2. Call Stack: Where code is executed

The JavaScript Runtime provides additional APIs that can be used by JavaScript code. In a browser environment, this includes the DOM, AJAX, setTimeout, etc.

Example of asynchronous behavior in the runtime:

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 0);

console.log("End");

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Timeout callback
```

## 3. Execution Contexts and The Call Stack

An execution context is an abstract concept that holds information about the environment within which the current code is being executed. There are three types:

1. Global Execution Context
2. Functional Execution Context
3. Eval Execution Context

The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the execution context of the program.

Example:

```javascript
function first() {
  console.log("Inside first function");
  second();
}

function second() {
  console.log("Inside second function");
}

console.log("Global context");
first();

// Output:
// Global context
// Inside first function
// Inside second function
```

## 4. Scope and The Scope Chain

Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript. There are three types of scope:

1. Global Scope
2. Function Scope
3. Block Scope (introduced with let and const in ES6)

The scope chain is the hierarchy of scopes that is searched for variable names.

Example:

```javascript
const globalVar = "I'm global";

function outerFunc() {
  const outerVar = "I'm from outer";

  function innerFunc() {
    const innerVar = "I'm from inner";
    console.log(innerVar); // Accessible
    console.log(outerVar); // Accessible
    console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
  }

  innerFunc();
}

outerFunc();
```

## 5. Scoping in Practice

Scoping in practice involves understanding how variables are accessed and where they are available in your code.

Example demonstrating lexical scoping:

```javascript
function outer() {
  let x = 10;

  function inner() {
    console.log(x); // 10
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

## 6. Variable Environment: Hoisting and The TDZ

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope. The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value.

Example:

```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined (hoisted)
var x = 5;

console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 10;
```

## 7. The this Keyword

The `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used:

- In a method, `this` refers to the owner object
- Alone, `this` refers to the global object
- In a function, `this` refers to the global object
- In strict mode, `this` in a function is undefined
- In an event, `this` refers to the element that received the event

Example:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

console.log(person.fullName()); // "John Doe"
```

## 8. Regular Functions vs. Arrow Functions

Regular functions and arrow functions have some key differences:

1. Syntax
2. `this` binding
3. Use of `arguments` object
4. Use as methods
5. Use as constructors

Example:

```javascript
// Regular function
function regularFunc(a, b) {
  console.log(arguments);
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow function
const arrowFunc = (a, b) => {
  // console.log(arguments); // ReferenceError
  return a + b;
};

const obj = {
  method: function () {
    console.log(this); // refers to obj
  },
  arrowMethod: () => {
    console.log(this); // refers to the global object or undefined in strict mode
  },
};
```

# JavaScript Advanced Concepts - Tasks

1. **JavaScript Engine Simulation**
   Create a simple simulation of a JavaScript engine's call stack. Implement functions to push and pop execution contexts, and demonstrate how different function calls would be processed.

2. **Scope Chain Exploration**
   Write a series of nested functions, each declaring variables. Then, create an innermost function that tries to access all the variables. Explain the scope chain in action.

3. **Hoisting Quirks**
   Write a program that demonstrates the quirks of hoisting with `var`, `let`, and `const`. Include function declarations and expressions in your example.

4. **This Keyword Binding**
   Create an object with methods that use `this`. Then, use these methods in different contexts (e.g., as callbacks, standalone functions) to demonstrate how `this` binding changes.

5. **Arrow Functions vs Regular Functions**
   Implement the same functionality using both arrow functions and regular functions. Focus on scenarios where their behavior differs, especially concerning `this` binding and the `arguments` object.

6. **Closure Challenge**
   Create a function that generates unique ID numbers. Use a closure to keep track of the last assigned ID.

7. **Promises and Async/Await**
   Write a series of asynchronous operations using Promises, then refactor it to use async/await. Explain the benefits and differences of each approach.

8. **Prototypal Inheritance**
   Implement a simple class hierarchy using JavaScript's prototypal inheritance. Then, recreate the same hierarchy using ES6 classes and explain the differences.

9. **Event Loop Visualization**
   Create a visual representation (through logging or actual graphics) of how the event loop processes synchronous and asynchronous code.

10. **Advanced Array Methods**
    Solve a complex problem using a combination of array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `flatMap`. Explain how each method contributes to the solution.
