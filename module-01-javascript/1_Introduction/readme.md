# Introduction to JavaScript

## What is Programming?

It is a way to talk to computers. A language like Hindi, English, or Bengali can be used to talk to a human but for computers, we need straightforward instructions.

Programming is the act of constructing a program, a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.

Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. It involves the use of programming languages and various tools to create software programs that can be run on a computer or other devices.

- Creates dynamic, interactive web pages
- Often used with HTML and CSS for enhanced web experiences
