# Lesson 9: Callbacks and Array Methods

## Concepts Covered

1. **Callbacks**
2. **Array Methods**:
   - `forEach()`
   - `map()`
   - `filter()`
   - `reduce()`
   - `sort()`

### Callbacks

Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after some operation has been completed. They are often used for asynchronous programming.
