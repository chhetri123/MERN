Add these feature to your application

1. **User Role Management**:

   - Implement different user roles (e.g., Admin, User) with different access levels. For example, only admins can add or delete countries, while regular users can view and edit.

2. **Pagination and Search**:

   - Add pagination for the list of countries and implement a search functionality to filter countries based on user input.

3. **Advanced Filtering and Sorting**:

   - Allow users to sort the country list by various attributes (e.g., name, population) and apply multiple filters (e.g., by continent, region).

4. **Real-time Updates with WebSockets**:
   - Use WebSockets (e.g., with Socket.IO) to notify users in real-time when a new country is added, updated, or deleted.
