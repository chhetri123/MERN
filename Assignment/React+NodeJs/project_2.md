### **Project Idea: Simple Book Sharing and Review Platform**

#### **Objective:**

Create a web application where users can share books, write reviews, and recommend books to others. The platform will allow users to maintain their personal book collections, rate and review books, and view other users' recommendations.

### **Project Requirements:**

#### **Backend (Node.js):**

1. **Set Up the Server:**

   - Use **Express.js** to create the backend server.
   - Use **MongoDB** to store user information, book details, reviews, and recommendations.

2. **API Endpoints to Implement:**

   - **User Authentication:**

     - `POST /api/register`: Register a new user.
     - `POST /api/login`: Authenticate the user and return a token.

   - **Book Collection:**

     - `POST /api/books`: Add a book to the user's collection.
     - `GET /api/books`: Retrieve all books in the user's collection.
     - `DELETE /api/books/:id`: Remove a book from the collection.

   - **Book Reviews:**

     - `POST /api/books/:id/review`: Add a review to a specific book.
     - `GET /api/books/:id/reviews`: Retrieve all reviews for a specific book.
     - `PUT /api/books/:id/review`: Update a review for a specific book.
     - `DELETE /api/books/:id/review`: Remove a review from a specific book.

   - **Recommendations:**
     - `POST /api/recommendations`: Recommend a book to other users.
     - `GET /api/recommendations`: Get book recommendations made by other users.

3. **Database Schema Design:**

   - **User Model:**

     ```javascript
     const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       name: String,
       email: { type: String, unique: true },
       password: String,
     });
     ```

   - **Book Model:**

     ```javascript
     const BookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       title: String,
       author: String,
       genre: String,
       description: String,
       userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" },
     });
     ```

   - **Review Model:**

     ```javascript
     const ReviewSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       bookId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Book" },
       userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" },
       rating: Number,
       review: String,
       createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
     });
     ```

   - **Recommendation Model:**
     ```javascript
     const RecommendationSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       bookId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Book" },
       userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" },
       message: String,
       createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
     });
     ```

#### **Frontend (React.js):**

1. **Set Up the Project Structure:**

   - Organize your React application with components for each feature (book collection, reviews, recommendations, etc.).

2. **Implement the Following Components:**

   - **Registration Component**: A form to register new users.
   - **Login Component**: A form for users to log in.
   - **Book Collection Component**: A section where users can add, view, and delete books from their personal collection.
   - **Book Review Component**: A form to write reviews for a book and view all reviews of that book.
   - **Recommendations Component**: A section to view recommendations from other users and to recommend books.
   - **Navbar Component**: A navigation bar to switch between different sections.

3. **Additional Features:**
   - **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for books in their collection.
   - **User Profile**: Display the user's profile with a list of books they have reviewed or recommended.

#### **Bonus Features (Optional):**

- **Public and Private Collections:** Allow users to mark their book collections as public or private.
- **Book Rating:** Implement a rating system for users to rate books (1-5 stars).
- **Filter Books by Genre:** Provide users with an option to filter books in their collection by genre.

### **Real-Time Communication (Optional Bonus):**

- Implement real-time notifications using **Socket.IO** to notify users when a new book is recommended by another user.

### **Coding Tips:**

- Use **environment variables** to manage sensitive data like the database connection URI.
- Handle **authentication and authorization** using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- For **HTTP requests** from React frontend to the backend, use **Axios** or the built-in `fetch()` method.
- Use **React Router** to manage routing in the frontend.
- Keep your React components organized and use **state management** (like Reactâ€™s `useState` and `useEffect`) for handling user interactions and fetching data.

### **Submission Requirements:**

- Submit your code repository link (e.g., GitHub) for review.
