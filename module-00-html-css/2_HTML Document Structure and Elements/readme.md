# HTML Document Structure and Elements

## 2.1. HTML Document Structure

An HTML document has a defined structure that includes several key elements. The basic structure includes the `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

### Key Points:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: Root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document (e.g., title, character set).
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the document.

## 2.2. HTML Elements

HTML elements are the building blocks of an HTML document. They consist of a start tag, content, and an end tag.

### Key Points:

- An element is represented by tags (e.g., `<p>` and `</p>`).
- Some elements are self-closing (e.g., `<img />`).

## 2.3. Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always included in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs like `name="value"`.

### Key Points:

- Common attributes include `href` for links, `src` for images, and `alt` for image descriptions.
- Attributes provide extra information and are placed within the opening tag.

## 2.4. Headings

HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags. `<h1>` defines the most important heading, while `<h6>` defines the least important heading.

### Key Points:

- Headings are used to structure content hierarchically.
- There are six levels of headings.

## 2.5. Paragraphs

Paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag. They are used to group blocks of text.

### Key Points:

- The `<p>` tag defines a paragraph.
- Paragraphs automatically add some space above and below the text.

## 2.6. Formatting Text

HTML provides several tags to format text, such as bold, italic, underline, and more.

### Key Points:

- `<b>` and `<strong>` make text bold.
- `<i>` and `<em>` make text italic.
- `<u>` underlines text.

## 2.7. Quotations

HTML supports quotations using the `<blockquote>` and `<q>` tags.

### Key Points:

- `<blockquote>` is used for block-level quotations.
- `<q>` is used for inline quotations.

## 2.8. Comments

Comments are used to add notes to the HTML code that are not displayed in the browser. They are helpful for documentation and debugging.

### Key Points:

- Comments start with `<!--` and end with `-->`.
- Comments are not displayed in the browser but can be seen in the source code.
