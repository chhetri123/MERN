# HTML Lists, Tables, and Frames

## 3.1. Unordered Lists

Unordered lists are used to group a set of related items in no particular order. They are created using the `<ul>` tag, and each list item is defined with the `<li>` tag.

### Key Points:

- `<ul>`: Defines an unordered list.
- `<li>`: Defines a list item.

## 3.2. Ordered Lists

Ordered lists are used to group a set of related items in a specific order. They are created using the `<ol>` tag, and each list item is defined with the `<li>` tag.

### Key Points:

- `<ol>`: Defines an ordered list.
- `<li>`: Defines a list item.

## 3.3. Definition Lists

Definition lists are used to define terms and their descriptions. They are created using the `<dl>` tag. Inside a definition list, terms are defined with the `<dt>` tag, and descriptions are defined with the `<dd>` tag.

### Key Points:

- `<dl>`: Defines a definition list.
- `<dt>`: Defines a term.
- `<dd>`: Defines a description.

## 3.4. Creating Tables

Tables are used to display data in rows and columns. A table is created using the `<table>` tag. Each row is defined with the `<tr>` tag, and each cell is defined with the `<td>` tag.

### Key Points:

- `<table>`: Defines a table.
- `<tr>`: Defines a table row.
- `<td>`: Defines a table cell.

## 3.5. Table Headers

Table headers are used to define the headings of the columns in a table. They are created using the `<th>` tag.

### Key Points:

- `<th>`: Defines a table header cell.
- Table headers are usually placed inside a `<thead>` section.

## 3.6. Table Cells

Table cells are the individual units of a table, defined with the `<td>` tag.

### Key Points:

- `<td>`: Defines a table cell.
- Cells can contain text, images, lists, and other HTML elements.

## 3.7. Table Borders

Table borders are used to define the borders of a table, rows, and cells. They can be styled using CSS.

### Key Points:

- Use the `border` attribute or CSS to define table borders.
- Example: `border: 1px solid black;`

## 3.8. Spanning Columns and Rows

Spanning allows a cell to extend across multiple columns or rows. This is done using the `colspan` and `rowspan` attributes.

### Key Points:

- `colspan`: Spans a cell across multiple columns.
- `rowspan`: Spans a cell across multiple rows.

## 3.9. Introduction to Frames

Frames are used to divide the browser window into multiple sections, each of which can load a separate HTML document. They are created using the `<frameset>` tag.

### Key Points:

- `<frameset>`: Defines a set of frames.
- Frames are deprecated in HTML5 and replaced with the `<iframe>` tag.

## 3.10. Creating Frames

Frames are created using the `<frame>` tag within a `<frameset>`. Each `<frame>` defines a single frame within the window.

### Key Points:

- `<frame>`: Defines a single frame.
- Frames can be styled and resized.

## 3.11. Nested Frames

Frames can be nested within each other to create more complex layouts.

### Key Points:

- Nested frames allow for more complex layouts.
- Use multiple `<frameset>` elements to nest frames.
