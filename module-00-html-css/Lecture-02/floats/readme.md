## Lecture on CSS `float` Property

### Introduction to `float`

The `float` property in CSS is used to position an element to the left or right of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it.

### Clearing Floats

When you use `float`, it's important to clear the float to prevent issues with the layout of subsequent elements. This can be done using the `clear` property.

### Practical Tasks

1. **Float an image and let text wrap around it**

   - Create an HTML file with a paragraph of text and an image.
   - Float the image to the left and add some margin to the right and bottom.
   - Ensure the text wraps around the image.

2. **Create a three-column layout**

   - Create three div elements inside a container.
   - Float each div to the left and set their width to 33.33%.
   - Clear the floats after the container.

3. **Build a simple navigation bar**
   - Create a list of links.
   - Float each list item to the left.
   - Style the navigation bar with background color and padding.

### Summary

The `float` property is a powerful tool for layout design in CSS. It allows elements to wrap around floated elements, creating complex and flexible designs. However, it's important to remember to clear floats to maintain the layout's integrity.
